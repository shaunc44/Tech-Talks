##Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)  

FOUC occurs when the browser displays the HTML portion of a webpage before the CSS renders (colors, fonts & styling)  


####How do we prevent FOUC?  

~ Put the link to the external css file in the head tag of the HTML file. This will improve page load times but also avoids having the browser repaint the page (FOUC).  


####How does a browser render a website?  

  1. Process HTML markup and build the DOM tree.  
  2. Process CSS markup and build the CSSOM tree.  
  3. Combine the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree.  
  4. Run layout on the render tree to compute geometry of each node.  
  5. Paint the individual nodes to the screen.
