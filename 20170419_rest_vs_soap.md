## What is the difference between a RESTful API and a SOAP api??  


### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)  
1. Is a protocol  
2. The heavyweight choice for web service access  
3. Strict standards  
4. Independent of language, platform and transport  
5. Uses XML  
6. Built-in error handling  


### REST (REpresentational State Transfer)  
1. Is an architectural style  
2. Lighter and more flexible, easier to build  
3. Not too many standards  
4. Requires less bandwidth  
4. Uses CSV, JSON, HTML, XML and plain text   


*SOAP is like an envelope whereas REST is like a postcard*
