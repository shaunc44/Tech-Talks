#QUICK SORT

1. Quick Sort is a comparison sort, meaning it can sort anything that has a "less-than" relation.

2. It can be 2 to 3 times faster than the *Merge Sort* and *Heap Sort*.

3. Best-Case Performance: O(n) or O(n log n) depending on how the data is partitioned.

4. Worst-Case Performance: O(n^2).
