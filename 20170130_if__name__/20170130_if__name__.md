#if __ name __ == â€œ__ main __" ?

1. Before executing code, Python defines **special variables**.

2. One special variable is **__ name __**.

  1. Python sets **__ name __** to the value **"__ main __"**.

  2. **"__ main __"** refers the name of the file that is being used.

  3. If working with a **single** file then if __ name __ == "__ main __"

  4. If working with an **import** file (aka module) then __ main __ refers to the name of the import file

### What's the purpose?

1. Use __ main __ check to test whether your code is being run directly or being imported

### EXAMPLE:

##### one.py
```
import two
```

##### two.py
```
print ("Hello World from %s!" % __name__)
if __name__ == '__main__':
	print ("Hello World again from %s!" % __name__)
```

##### Output:

```
$ python one.py
Hello World from two!
```
```
$ python two.py
Hello World from __main__!
Hello World again from __main__!
```

#Python Expressions vs. Statements

**Expressions** contain identifiers, literals and operators and *evaluates to a value*.
```
x = 1
y = x + 2 (this is an expression)
```

**Statements** *represent an action or command*
```
print(y) (this is a statement)
```
