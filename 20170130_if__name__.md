#if __ name __ == â€œ__ main __" ?

1. Before executing code, Python defines **special variables**.

2. One special variable is **__ name __**.

  1. Python sets **__ name __** to the value **"__ main __"**.

  2. **"__ main __"** refers the name of the file that is being used.

  3. If working with a **single** file called "one.py" then if __ name __ == "one"

  4. If working with an **import** file (aka module) then __ main __ refers to the name of the import file

### What's the purpose?

1. Use __ main __ check to test whether your code is being run directly or being imported

### EXAMPLE:

##### one.py
```  import two```

##### two.py
```  print "Hello World from %s!" % __name__```

```  if __name__ == '__main__':
		print "Hello World again from %s!" % __name__```

##### Output:

```
$ python a.py
Hello World from b!
```
```
$ python b.py
Hello World from __main__!
Hello World again from __main__!
```
