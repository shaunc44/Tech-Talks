##What is SSH?  

*Secure Shell* (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network  

1. Common application - enables command-line login on a remote compute  

2. Allows two parties to authenticate each side and then pass commands and output back and forth  

3. Two versions of SSH are SSH-1 and SSH-2  
	a. SSH-1 has vulnerabilities  
	b. SSH-2 is more secure, but Edward Snowden reported that the NSA has ability to de-crypt SSH-2  

##How does SSH work?

1. SSH creates a secure tunnel between the two parties  

2. Uses symmetrical encryption, asymmetrical encryption, and hashing  

	a. Symmetrical encryption uses *one* key to encrypt the entire connection  

	b. Asymmetrical encryption uses *two* keys (Public key & Private key) to encrypt the entire connection  

	c. Hashing creates a signature (or summary) of a set of information which is used to verify data integrity
